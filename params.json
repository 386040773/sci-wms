This is where the installation will live.\r\n\r\n####If you have the standard enthought python distribution (epd):\r\n\r\nInstall the remaining dependencies:\r\n\r\n    $easy_install gunicorn\r\n    $easy_install greenlet\r\n    $easy_install gevent              # or easy_install eventlet\r\n    $easy_install django\r\n\r\n####If are not using the enthought python distribution:\r\n\r\nYou must have the following python packages installed:\r\n\r\n- django\r\n- gunicorn\r\n- greenlet\r\n- gevent or eventlet\r\n- numpy\r\n- matplotlib (1.1.0 preferred)\r\n- matplotlib basemap (versions 1.0.1)\r\n- netCDF4 (Install from the netcdf4-python google code repository if using HDF a recent build of HDF5)\r\n- shapely\r\n- markdown\r\n\r\nsci-wms works with both pip and virtualenv quite happily. If you\r\nhave pip installed you can use the following to install many (but not all) of the required modules:\r\n\r\n    $pip install package\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nOr you can install the required packages (with the versions we develop\r\nthe wms on) with the requirements file:\r\n\r\n    $pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimilarly if you have setup_tools installed you can use:\r\n\r\n    $easy_install package\r\n\r\nIf you are using virtualenv, just make sure you have the environment\r\nactivated before you try to install the packages or point to the environment\r\nwith pip on the install command.\r\n\r\nYou also need to ensure that you have basemap matplotlib toolkit installed:\r\n\r\n    $wget -o basemap-1.0.1.tar.gz http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib-toolkits/basemap-1.0.1/basemap-1.0.1.tar.gz/download\r\n    $pip install basemap-1.0.1.tar.gz","tagline":"Sci-wms: A Python WMS service for geospatial gridded data (Only unstructured FVCOM and ADCIRC grids logically rectangular grids supported)"}
